## Comments and Wishes

Bye Bye Svet :( soooooo sad to see you go. It's been wonderful having you in 9JI and then 9Now. And its been even better having you as a friend. I will miss our bathroom and kitchen chats during the day. But we have FB and will have to catch up with Maria very soon. So until then all the best, take care and kick ass in your new role. I know you will do great! Love u lots xox Shireen xox
