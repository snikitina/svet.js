It has been amazing! You were our PR Ninja...and it makes me really sad to know my horrible code won't be under your watchful eye.

We made an amazing weather page eh?! Except for those WZ APIs. They...weren't fun.

Well, I'm sure we'll see each other around. And you'll have an amazing next stage in life. Whatever that is.
High five!
